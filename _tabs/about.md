# About Me

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Luan Sim√µes (a.k.a Snizi). I am a security researcher, Information System student at [FURG](https://www.furg.br/en/) and developer. Currently, I am employed as a Software Security Engineer at [DefensePoint](https://defensepoint.com/).

## Areas of Interest
I love CTF's and all areas inside cybersecurity, specially game hacking (even if I suck at it) and I am currently learning malwaredev aswell.
