# About Me

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Luan Sim√µes (a.k.a Snizi). I am a Information Systems student at [FURG](https://www.furg.br/en/), developer and cybersecurity researcher. Currently, I am employed as a Software Security Engineer at [DefensePoint](https://defensepoint.com/).

## Areas of Interest
I love CTF's and all areas inside cybersecurity, specially game hacking (even if I suck at it). I am currently learning malwaredev aswell.
